1) General description
WRF-Hydro is a coupling architecture designed to simplify the coupling of terrestrial 
hydrological models with the WRF model. The WRF-Hydro system is compiled as an independent 
library to link with the WRF model and called by the WRF model as a function. The calling 
of WRF-Hydro within the WRF model is controlled by a macro definition that is specified 
as an environment setting during the compiling process. When WRF-Hydro is not activated 
within the environment setting before the WRF configuration process, the entire system 
<<<<<<< HEAD
defaults to the standard WRF model. To compile WRF-Hydro system, user only needs to set 
environment variable ("setenv WRF_HYDRO 1"), and then follow the standard WRF model 
configure and compiling process.

defaults to the standard WRF model. To compile the WRF-Hydro system, the user needs to set 
the "WRF_HYDRO" environment variable to 1 and then follow the standard WRF model 
configure and compile process.

2) Environment settings
The following environment variables need to be set before configuring and compiling the WRF-HYDRO model:

setenv WRF_HYDRO 1
"1" is to activate WRF-Hydro. "0" or no definition will default to the WRF model only.

setenv HYDRO_D 1
A "1" for HYDRO_D results in WRF-Hydro producing some run-time diagnostic information. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
When HYDRO_D is set to "0 "or not defined, the diagnostic information will not be produced 
during run-time. 
=======
When HYDRO_D is set to "0 "or not defined, the additional diagnostic information will not be produced.

You can explicitly set the "NETCDF_INC" and "NETCDF_LIB" environment variables or just set "NETCDF".  
If you only set "NETCDF" environment variable, the default NETCDF_INC and NETCDF_LIB inside WRF-Hydro 
will be "$NETCDF/include" and "NETCDF/lib".

setenv NETCDF_INC   "$path/netcdf/include"
setenv NETCDF_LIB   "$path/netcdf/lib"

"NETCDF_INC" and "NETCDF_LIB" are defined for the WRF-Hydro only and can be different from those 
set for the WRF model. WRF-Hydro has two netcdf libraries for Fortran and C respectively: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
libnetcdff and ibnetcdf. If the user's netcdf library combined them together (only has one),

>>>>>>> b1b191b5bc4e1e579b5a1fc399451b14a647f834
the user will need to manually change this part in order to successfully compile WRF-Hydro. 
See the section below on porting about how to change this.

3) Configuring and compiling
On the following platforms, the configuring and compiling commands are the same as WRF model 
after the user has set up the above four environment variables. The default supported platform 
is Linux with the PGI (Portland Group) compiler.  The compiler options IBM AIX with xlf fortran, 
Linux with GFORTRAN and Intel are not fully tested yet and may not readily work.  As stated above, 
the WRF-Hydro system is called as a function inside the WRF model and thus only one executable 
is created when WRF-Hydro is compiled with WRF.  If user compiles the system successfully, 
only a single "wrf.exe" file will be created.

2. Running

The fully coupled WRF/WRF-Hydro system has the same running or execution command as that of WRF.  
Generally the same parameters and initial files are used as when normally running WRF.  However, 
WRF-Hydro has an additional namelist called "hydro.namelist" as well as some additional parameter 
files (.TBL files) that are located under the "hydro/Run" directory. Users need to copy those 
files to the directory where the "wrf.exe" is going to be executed. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
For a WRF-Hydro cold start run (i.e. not from a restart file), the user needs to provide three 
additional files that are specified in the "hydro.namelist": "GEO_STATIC_FLNM", "GEO_FINEGRID_FLNM" 
and, depending on whether or not the baseflow-bucket model is activated, "gwbasmskfil".

For running WRF-Hydro from restart file, the user needs to uncomment RESTART_FILE from 
"hydro.namelist" by removing "!" and provide the exact name for the existing restart file 
to be used.  Running from a restart condition is common when the land surface has been 
`spun-up' by running WRF-Hydro in an offline or `uncoupled' capacity.

3. Porting

The WRF-Hydro does not presently support OPENMP. The default support platform is Linux 
with the PGI compiler, IBM AIX with the xlf fortran compiler, and Linux with the GFORTRAN 
(sequential) compiler. However, WRF-Hydro is fairly easy to port to other systems.  
=======
Depending upon the physics options selected for WRF-Hydro, a number of other domain and parameter
files may be required. These are usually stored in a DOMAIN directory within the run directory. 
For more information regarding these files consult the WRF-Hydro documentation.

When running WRF-Hydro from restart file, the user needs to uncomment RESTART_FILE from 
"hydro.namelist" by removing "!" and provide the exact name for the existing restart file 
to be used.  Running from a restart condition is common and an example of where this can be useful
is when the land surface and other hydro components have been `spun-up' by running WRF-Hydro in an
offline or `uncoupled' capacity prior to running the coupled modeling system.

3. Porting

The WRF-Hydro does not presently support OpenMP. The default support platform is Linux 
with the Intel Fortran compiler, PGI Fortran compiler, or GNU Fortran compiler. However, WRF-Hydro
should be fairly easy to port to other systems.

The basic steps to do so are as follows:

1) Edit "hydro/configure", and add "exit(0);" to the second line so that "configure" will not be executed.
2) Edit "hydro/macros" to set desired compiling options. 
3) Under hydro/CPL/WRF_cpl directory:
"make -f Makefile.cpl clean"
"make -f Makefile.cpl "

If there is no error, then user can compile the fully coupled WRF and WRF-Hydro model on the new platform.
